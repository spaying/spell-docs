Last updated: December 15, 2025

By adding spell ("the Bot") to your Discord server or using its commands, you agree to these Terms of Service.

1. Compliance with Discord
   - You must follow Discord's Terms of Service[](https://discord.com/terms) and Community Guidelines at all times while using the Bot.

2. Bot Usage
   - The Bot provides username rarity checking and related features across multiple platforms (Discord, Minecraft, Roblox, TikTok, GitHub, Kick, Medal.tv, and others).
   - Do not abuse the Bot, including spamming commands, attempting to overload it, or using it for malicious purposes.
   - Username checks and rarity scans are provided as-is. We do not guarantee accuracy, availability of usernames, or successful sniping outcomes.

3. Liability
   - The developer and the Bot are not responsible for any issues arising from use, including failed username claims, account actions, or disputes.
   - Use of the Bot is at your own risk.

4. Changes
   - These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of changes.
