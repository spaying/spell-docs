# Privacy Policy for spell

Last updated: December 15, 2025

spell respects your privacy. This policy explains what data the Bot processes and how.

1. Data Processed
   - When you use commands (e.g., ;check <username>), the Bot temporarily processes the provided username to check rarity across platforms.
   - The ;checkrare command fetches current server member usernames (publicly visible) to scan for rare ones.
   - Word lists (e.g., known usernames per platform) are loaded from local files for comparison.

2. Data Storage
   - No usernames, user IDs, or personal data are stored permanently.
   - The only persistent data is setup channel configurations (channel and message IDs) in setup_channels.json for button functionality.
   - All username processing is temporary and deleted after the command completes.

3. Data Sharing
   - No data is shared with third parties.
   - No data is sold, logged, or used for any purpose beyond providing Bot features.

4. Discord Data
   - The Bot uses standard Discord gateway intents to function (Guilds, Members, Message Content for commands).
   - All data handling complies with Discord's Developer Policies.

By using spell, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

For concerns, contact the developer (@glamorizing , @scrolling) on Discord.

Thank you for using spell! 🎸
